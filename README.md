## 📦 What's Included

### 🔹 Infrared (IR) Toolkit
A collection of IR signal files for testing and learning about device control via infrared. Great for experimenting with remotes and basic signal replay.

### 🔹 Sub-GHz Resources
Dive into older wireless systems and obscure frequencies. Includes files and configs for analyzing Sub-GHz communication (e.g., garage remotes, key fobs).

### 🔹 BadUSB & BLE
Explore USB and Bluetooth Low Energy attack surfaces. Includes safe testing scripts and payloads designed for learning—not causing harm.

### 🔹 Captive Portals
A set of prebuilt "evil portal" templates designed to simulate phishing environments. Useful for understanding user behavior and redirection tactics in a secure environment.

### 🔹 Tutorials & Diagrams
- Hardware wiring guides for the M5Stick C Plus 2 and accessories
- Hands-on walkthroughs of WiFi jamming, deauth attacks, and protocol analysis
- Educational breakdowns of tool usage and real-world implications

### 🔹 MyProducts
Showcase of actual hardware setups and configurations used in the project. Helpful for understanding how tools are sourced, connected, and deployed responsibly.
